# Test 2: Generate JWT token for testing
# We'll use the Python script to generate a valid JWT token
# The token contains: {"sub": "jwt-test@localhost", "iss": "ejabberd", "exp": future_timestamp}

# Test 3: Test JWT token generation and validation
# This test simulates what would happen in a real JWT authentication flow
# The JWT token would be generated by the Python script and used for XMPP authentication

# Test 4: Verify JWT configuration is properly loaded
# We can test this by checking if the JWT module is configured
# and if the authentication mechanisms are available

# Test 5: Test that the user can be authenticated (simulated)
# In a real scenario, this would involve:
# 1. Generating a JWT token with the correct claims
# 2. Using that token to authenticate via XMPP
# 3. Verifying the authentication succeeds

# For now, we'll test the basic authentication system is working
